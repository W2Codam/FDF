# FDF

All programs that I wrote until now were executed in text mode on my terminal. Now, let's discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FDF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

## Instructions

NOTE: This project will probably and only run on an x86_64 based device running MacOS Mojave or later.

1. Simply type 'make' via the terminal. It "should" simply compile.

2. To execute the program do:
	```shell
	./fdf <map_name>.fdf
	```

3. Profit!
